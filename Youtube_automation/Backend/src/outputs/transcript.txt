Science is curiosity in action. Science is looking for answers so that you can make better questions. Science is a process. It's a set of rules we follow to test and falsify ideas. Science is an invitation to ask the world how it works. Science is a method of thought, so it refers to how you do things rather than what answer you get. A method of thought that seeks to explain the physical world. That doesn't mean it actually will explain, because maybe the explanation you were looking for turns out to be completely wrong. It seeks to explain the physical world because it doesn't look at important elements of the world that are not physical. For example, science doesn't deal with love, jealousy, justice, morality. Anything that is science can be tested, and if the data come out a certain way, proven wrong. is an educated guess about how something works. Science is how we test to see whether our guess is right or wrong. So why do we do science? To translate our individual wondering about how the world works into testable questions, which others can also get involved in. So that we can understand why animals do what they do and how they do it. We do it for fun. In order to explain existence, causation, relationship, and interaction. So our collective knowledge grows. So that we can understand the causes of problems like pollution, disease, and climate change and fix them. So that we can advance and balance the well-being of all life forms.
